Highlight Feedback View

Functionality walkthrough:

Upon entry to the highlight feedback page you will see two sections. The section on the left is a canvas which displays the file that can be highlighted. The section on the right will display the feedback items for the corresponding highlights.

Use the mouse cursor to select a line of text on the file to provide feedback for. After making the highlight selection a window with a textbox will pop up. Please enter your feedback corresponding to the highlight in the textbox and click submit. If no text is entered and the user clicks out of the popup, the feedback will be cancelled. After clicking submit, note that there is now a highlight over the text selected in the file. A corresponding feedback item is placed in the "Feedback Items" section. The feeback item will contain a title (feedback entered in textbox), and description (highlighted text). Users can make multiple highlights following the same steps.

Clicking a feedback item will focus the canvas on the corresponding highlight and make the colour of the highlight green. Moving the mouse out of the feedback item will unselect the selected highlight and change the colour back to yellow. Users can easily find a specific feedback by clicking through the feedback items.

A user should click the post button located in the top right after they are done making highlights on the page.
